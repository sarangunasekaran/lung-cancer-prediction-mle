The insight into lung cancer's prediction is possible only due to the changes in disease-related data and recent development of machine learning. The current process of Medicine usually starts with the symptoms, which might not be clear at the early stage of cancer, to diagnose the disease and for treatments that aim to cure it.

For example, chest pain is one of the most frequent symptoms in lung cancer patients. However, this symptom is also common in other diseases, such as coronary heart disease or angina pectoris, so chest pain alone canâ€™t really be used to predict lung cancer. If a machine learning model can identify patterns in many different symptoms (such as cough, fever and weight loss) that are highly specific to the development of lung cancer and could provide guidance on how to treat it earlier; it would be helpful for clinical doctors.

This works with the dataset that puts an algorithm to find out if a person has a lung cancer with the systoms they experienced.
